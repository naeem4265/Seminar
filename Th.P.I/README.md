On May 2, 2023, I attended a seminar on 'Career and CP Guidance' at Thakurgaon Polytechnic Institute as a guest. 
The honorable CI sir, teachers, and students of Th.P.I were present at the seminar. 
I delivered a speech to motivate the students to start competitive programming 
and discussed how to prepare for ICPC and IUPC. 
It was a great experience for me.
